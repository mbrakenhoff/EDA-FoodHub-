FoodHub Order Analysis
Project Overview
This project was completed for the MIT Professional Education program, Data Science and Machine Learning: Making Data-Driven Decisions. The project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a food delivery service, FoodHub. The goal of the analysis is to analyze stored data on customer orders to understand the demand for different restaurants and enhance customer experience.

Context
The number of restaurants in New York is growing, and many students and busy professionals rely on these restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. FoodHub, a food aggregator company, offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app, providing a convenient online food delivery service.

The app allows restaurants to receive direct online orders, assigns a delivery person to pick up the order, and ensures delivery to the customer's location. Customers can rate their orders, and FoodHub earns revenue by collecting a fixed margin from the delivery orders.
